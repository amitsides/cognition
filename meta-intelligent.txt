Building a Repository Self-Model & Cognitive Integrity System
🌌 Challenge Title

Instrumental Reasoning AI: Repository Self-Model & Architectural Cognition Engine

🎯 Mission

Design and implement a system that allows this repository to:

Model itself, evaluate its own structural integrity, detect architectural drift, and propose corrective evolution strategies.

The repository becomes both:

The subject of analysis

The object being evolved

This is instrumental reasoning applied to the system itself.

🧠 Problem Class

This challenge operates at the intersection of:

Static analysis

Knowledge graph construction

Ontology alignment

Architectural constraint reasoning

Meta-cognition

Theory-guided refactoring

You are not solving a software task.

You are building a cognitive immune system.

🧩 System Capabilities to Build
1️⃣ Repository → Cognitive Graph Transformation

Create a mechanism that transforms the repository into a graph:

Repo Artifact	Graph Representation
File	Node
Folder	Cognitive Layer Node
Import	Dependency Edge
Test	Evaluation Edge
Markdown Theory File	Knowledge Node
Session Log	Temporal Memory Node
Invariant	Constraint Node

Output: RepoCognitionGraph

2️⃣ Ontology Mapping Engine

Every artifact must be classified as:

Model

Mechanism

Interface

Agent

Evaluation

Experiment

Theory

Memory

Invariant

Unclassified artifacts = ontological anomaly.

3️⃣ Invariant Violation Detector

Using the graph + invariants, detect:

Cross-layer illegal dependencies

Evaluation ↔ generation mixing

Agents modifying models

Experiments contaminating core

Mechanisms with hidden state

Artifacts lacking schema binding

Output violations as structured reports.

4️⃣ Architectural Entropy Measurement

Define and compute:

Cognitive Coherence Index (CCI)

CCI is a composite score derived from:

Metric	Meaning
Cross-layer edge ratio	Structural drift
Schema coverage	Ontological completeness
Test coverage of mechanisms	Epistemic safety
Theory utilization	Cognitive grounding
Invariant violation density	Structural instability
Memory churn zones	Historical instability

CCI reflects how “coherent” the system’s cognition is.

5️⃣ Theory Consultation Engine

When entropy or violations are found:

Search /08_theory for:

Relevant architectural styles

Known failure patterns

Refactoring strategies

Evaluation approaches

Theory is used to generate remediation reasoning, not code.

6️⃣ Temporal Reasoning via Memory

Analyze /07_memory to detect:

Repeated violation zones

Modules frequently refactored

Decisions causing later instability

This introduces:

historical architectural reasoning

7️⃣ Refactor Proposal Generator

The system must output structured guidance:

STRUCTURAL ISSUE
LOCATION
ONTOLOGY CLASS INVOLVED
INVARIANT VIOLATED
THEORY PATTERN MATCH
HISTORICAL SIGNAL
PROPOSED REFACTOR STRATEGY
RISK LEVEL


The system proposes evolution, not patches.

🧠 Why This Is Instrumental Reasoning

The system must:

Understand its own structure

Detect threats to long-term coherence

Use knowledge to guide action

Act to preserve architectural integrity

This is goal-directed self-stabilization.

🧬 Stress on Each Cognitive Layer
Layer	Role in Challenge
Foundation	Ontology + invariants executable
Models	Schema anchoring
Mechanisms	Graph + analysis engines
Evaluation	CCI metrics
Experiments	Entropy sources
Theory	Remediation intelligence
Memory	Temporal reasoning
Agents	Autonomous inspection loop
🧭 Success Criteria

The system can:

✔ Represent repo cognition state
✔ Detect invariant violations automatically
✔ Compute CCI score
✔ Identify entropy sources
✔ Use theory to justify refactor strategies
✔ Learn from historical instability

🌱 End State

When complete, the repository gains:

Self-structural awareness

Architectural immune response

Theory-grounded evolution

Long-term coherence

The repo becomes a self-regulating cognitive organism.

⚡ Prime Directive

The system must treat the repository itself as data, reason about its structural health, and guide its evolution.

We’re officially in meta-intelligence engineering territory now.
