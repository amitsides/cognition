# Cross-Domain Isomorphism Brokerage

## Business Plan

---

## I. Executive Summary

**Company:** Isomorphic Intelligence Corp (IIC)

**One-liner:** We find solved problems in Field A that are structurally identical to unsolved problems in Field B — and broker the transfer.

**Core thesis:** Most hard problems have already been solved — just in a different domain, using different vocabulary, published in journals nobody in your industry reads. The structural solutions exist. The translation doesn't. We are the translation layer.

**Revenue model:** Brokerage fees on cognitive IP transfer + subscription intelligence + licensing of isomorphism maps.

**Market:** Every R&D department, every consulting firm, every research institution that is spending millions solving problems that have known structural equivalents elsewhere.

**Defensibility:** Proprietary isomorphism graph (the map of all known structural equivalences across domains), growing via network effects. The more transfers we broker, the denser the graph, the more valuable the next match.

## II. The Problem

### 2.1 The Invisible Redundancy Crisis

Humanity solves the same structural problem thousands of times across different fields:

| Domain A (Solved) | Domain B (Unsolved/Expensive) | Structural Equivalence |
|---|---|---|
| Protein folding energy minimization | Supply chain network optimization | Constraint satisfaction on graphs |
| Epidemiological spread models | Viral marketing propagation | SIR diffusion dynamics |
| Fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) | Traffic flow optimization | Continuum flow equations |
| Ant colony optimization (biology) | Telecommunications routing | Stigmergic path optimization |
| Crystallography symmetry groups | Music composition theory | Group-theoretic transformation |
| Ecological predator-prey models | Market competition dynamics | Lotka-Volterra systems |
| Quantum error correction codes | Financial portfolio hedging | Redundancy under noise |
| Neural pruning (neuroscience) | Network architecture search (ML) | Sparse optimization |
| Tectonic stress propagation | Organizational failure cascades | Percolation theory |
| Immune system T-cell selection | Spam filtering algorithms | Negative selection classification |

### 2.2 Why This Persists

- **Vocabulary barriers:** Same math, different words. A biologist and a logistics engineer will never find each other's papers.
- **Publication silos:** Journals are domain-locked. Cross-referencing is manual and rare.
- **Incentive misalignment:** Academics are rewarded for novelty within their field, not for finding equivalences across fields.
- **Cognitive entrenchment:** Experts are trained to think in their domain's metaphors. The structural abstraction layer is invisible to them.

### 2.3 The Cost

- Redundant R&D spend estimated at **$200B+ annually** across global industries (derived from: duplicate patent filings, parallel research programs, reinvented algorithms).
- Time-to-solution delays of **2-10 years** when a structural solution already exists elsewhere.
- Missed breakthroughs where the cross-domain insight would have been the catalyst.

## III. The Solution

### 3.1 What We Build

**The Isomorphism Engine** — an AI cognition system that:

1. **Ingests** the formal structure of problems across all domains (papers, patents, codebases, mathematical formulations)
2. **Abstracts** each problem into domain-agnostic structural representations (category theory, graph structures, algebraic forms, topological invariants)
3. **Matches** unsolved problems against the database of solved structural equivalents
4. **Translates** the solution from the source domain's language into the target domain's language
5. **Validates** the structural transfer via formal verification before human handoff

### 3.2 The Cognitive Stack

```
Layer 5: TRANSLATION    — Re-express solution in target domain vocabulary
Layer 4: VALIDATION     — Verify structural equivalence formally
Layer 3: MATCHING       — Find solved isomorphic structures
Layer 2: ABSTRACTION    — Strip domain-specific language, extract structure
Layer 1: INGESTION      — Parse problems from any domain representation
```

### 3.3 What We Do NOT Build

- We do not solve problems. We find that they've already been solved.
- We do not create AI agents. We create cognitive maps.
- We do not replace domain experts. We give them solved structures from outside their field that they then adapt.

**SAM: $72B** (problems where structural transfer is feasible with current AI cognition capabilities).

### 4.3 Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Year 1:** $5M (pilot brokerage deals)
**Year 3:** $80M (subscription + brokerage at scale)
**Year 5:** $500M (platform + licensing + data moat)

### 4.4 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor Type | What They Do | Why We're Different |
|---|---|---|
| Management Consulting (McKinsey, BCG) | Cross-industry best practices | They transfer *practices*, we transfer *mathematical structures* |
| Patent Search (Google Patents, Patsnap) | Keyword-based prior art | They match *words*, we match *structures* |
| Academic Cross-Referencing (Semantic Scholar) | Citation and topic linking | They link *papers*, we link *solved problem topologies* |
| AI Research Labs (DeepMind, OpenAI) | Solve hard problems directly | They *solve*, we *find that it's already solved* |

**Key differentiator:** Nobody else operates at the structural abstraction layer. Everyone else is trapped in domain-specific vocabulary.

## V. Business Model

### 5.1 Revenue Streams

#### Stream 1: Brokerage Fees (Core)

- Client presents unsolved problem.
- We identify structural equivalent in another domain.
- We deliver translated solution framework.
- **Fee: 2-8% of estimated R&D savings** from not having to solve from scratch.
- Average deal: $200K-$5M per transfer.

#### Stream 2: Isomorphism Intelligence Subscription

- Continuous monitoring of a client's problem portfolio against emerging solutions in all other domains.
- **Alert service:** "A solution structurally equivalent to your Problem X was just published in [unrelated field]."
- **Pricing:** $50K-$500K/year depending on portfolio size.

#### Stream 3: Isomorphism Map Licensing

- License access to the growing structural equivalence graph.
- Researchers, consultants, and R&D teams can explore the map directly.
- **Pricing:** $10K-$100K/year per seat tier.

#### Stream 4: Validation-as-a-Service

- Third parties bring candidate isomorphisms; we formally verify structural equivalence.
- **Pricing:** $5K-$50K per verification.

### 5.2 Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average brokerage deal | $1.2M |
| Cost to identify + validate + translate | $150K |
| Gross margin per deal | 87.5% |
| Average subscription ARR | $180K |
| Subscription gross margin | 92% |
| Customer acquisition cost (enterprise) | $80K |
| LTV:CAC ratio (target) | 15:1 |

### 5.3 Pricing Philosophy

We price on **value of time saved**, not effort expended. If a structural transfer saves a pharma company 3 years and $40M in R&D, a $2M brokerage fee is trivially justified.

|---|---|
| Mathematical structure extraction | Parse any domain formulation into abstract algebra |
| Category-theoretic reasoning | Identify functorial mappings between problem categories |
| Analogical reasoning at scale | Find non-obvious structural parallels |
| Formal verification | Prove equivalence, not just suggest it |
| Domain-specific translation | Re-express abstract solutions in target vocabulary |

## X. Risk Analysis

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Structural equivalences are rarer than hypothesized | High | Start with known equivalences from published literature. Validate frequency before scaling. |
| Clients can't implement transferred solutions | Medium | Include translation + onboarding as service tier. We deliver implementation-ready frameworks, not raw math. |
| Incumbents (consulting firms) copy the model | Medium | They lack the formal verification engine and the graph data asset. Speed + depth = moat. |
| AI cognition can't reliably abstract problem structures | High | Phase 1 is human-driven. Automate incrementally. Maintain human-in-the-loop for high-value transfers. |
| IP/legal complications in transferring solution structures | Medium | Mathematical structures are not patentable. We transfer structural patterns, not implementations. Legal opinion pre-secured. |
| Domain experts reject "outside" solutions | Medium | Frame as "accelerator" not "replacement." Domain experts adapt the transfer; we don't bypass them. |

## XI. Competitive Moat (Deepening Over Time)

```
Year 0: Human expertise in cross-domain pattern matching
          |
Year 1: Curated database of 100+ verified isomorphisms
          |
Year 2: Automated structural matching engine
          |
Year 3: Proprietary isomorphism graph (100K+ nodes, 1M+ edges)
          |
Year 4: Network effects — every client's problems enrich the graph
          |
Year 5: Industry standard for structural equivalence certification
          |
Year 7+: The graph IS the moat. Unreproducible without
          years of verified cross-domain transfers.
```

## XII. Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators

- Isomorphism graph density (edges per node)
- Structural match rate (% of submitted problems with a valid match)
- Translation fidelity score (client assessment of solution usability)
- Time from problem submission to verified match

### Lagging Indicators

- Revenue per transfer
- Client R&D savings (verified post-engagement)
- Subscription retention rate
- Publications/patents enabled by our transfers

---

## XIII. Vision

### The End State

Every time anyone anywhere formulates a hard problem, it is automatically checked against the entirety of human solved-problem knowledge — not by keywords, not by domain, but by **mathematical structure**.

The result: humanity stops solving the same problem twice.

**IIC becomes the cognitive infrastructure layer for cross-domain innovation** — the structural translation backbone that connects all of human knowledge at the level of pure form.
