# Agentic Cognition MAS

## Overview
Agentic Cognition MAS (Multi-Agent System) is a cutting-edge framework designed for meta-agentic cognition, integrating reasoning, reflection, heuristics, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and adaptive memory hierarchies. This architecture aims to enhance the capabilities of AI systems by unifying various cognitive processes into a cohesive structure.

## Features
- **Hybrid Representation**: Combines symbolic and vector representations for enhanced reasoning and learning.
- **Hierarchical Memory**: Implements a structured memory system to manage sensory, working, episodic, and long-term memories.
- **Cognitive Mechanisms**: Utilizes advanced techniques such as Tree-of-Thoughts search and deduction engines for problem-solving.
- **Reflection & Meta-Control**: Incorporates mechanisms for dynamic strategy adjustment and learning from experiences.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Facilitates cooperation among specialized agents to ensure robust and efficient task execution.
